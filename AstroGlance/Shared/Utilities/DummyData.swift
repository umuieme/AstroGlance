The featured galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partner is known as Arp 273. The overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions. This ring's blue color is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.  The inner galaxy appears older, redder, and threaded with cool filamentary dust.  A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to UGC 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background.  Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.

About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova, leaving the Veil Nebula.  At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  The featured picture was taken in Kuwait in mid-2024 and features light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue.  In deep images of the complete Veil Nebula like this, even studious readers might not be able to identify the iconic filaments.

Airglow.  Now, air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see. A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth's atmosphere. These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.  The long-duration exposure nearly along the vertical walls of airglow likely made the undulating structure particularly visible.  OK, but where do the colors originate?  The deep red glow likely originates from OH molecules about 87 kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun. The orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.  The featured image was captured during a climb up Mount Pico in the Azores of Portugal.  Ground lights originate from the island of Faial in the Atlantic Ocean.  A spectacular sky is visible through this banded airglow, with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy running up the image center, and M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, visible near the top left.

No -- the night sky changes every night in many ways. To better explore how the night sky changes, the USA's NSF and DOE commissioned the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile. In final testing before routine operations, Rubin will begin to explore these nightly changes -- slight differences that can tell us much about our amazing universe and its surprising zoo of objects. With a mirror over 8 meters across, Rubin will continually reimage the entire visible sky every few nights to discover new supernovas, potentially dangerous asteroids, faint comets, and variable stars -- as well as mapping out the visible universe's large-scale structure.  Pictured, the distant central band of our Milky Way Galaxy appears to flow out from the newly operational observatory. Taken last month, the featured picture is a composite of 21 images across the night sky, capturing airglow on the horizon and the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy on the lower left.

A navigational aid for sailors on the Adriatic Sea, the historic lighthouse was constructed in the early 19th century. But Polaris, an even older aid to navigation, shines in the sky above. Alpha star of the constellation Ursa Minor, Polaris is also known as the North Star. In this scene Polaris forms the shortest bright arc near the North Celestial Pole, the extension of Earth's axis of rotation into space. Of course, the North Celestial Pole lies exactly at the center of all the concentric star trails. The composite image is a digital stack of 400 exposures, each 30 seconds long, taken with camera and tripod fixed to a rotating planet.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SavudrijaSTARTRAILS_Nadj.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Savudrija Star Trails","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SavudrijaSTARTRAILS_Nadj1024.jpg"},{"copyright":"Mike Selby","date":"2025-06-06","explanation":"The bright clusters and nebulae of planet Earth's night sky are often given the names of flowers or insects, and its whopping 3 light-year wingspan, NGC 6302 is no exception. With an estimated surface temperature of about 250,000 degrees C, the central star of the planetary nebula is transforming into a white dwarf star, becoming exceptionally hot, and shining brightly in ultraviolet light. The central star is hidden from direct view by a torus of dust, but its energetic ultraviolet light ionizes atoms in the nebula. In this sharp, telescopic view composed with narrowband image data, the ionized hydrogen and doubly ionized oxygen atoms are shown in their characteristic red and blue-green hues to reveal a stunning complex of knots and filaments within the nebula's wing-like bipolar outflows. NGC 6302 lies about 4,000 light-years away in the arachnologically correct constellation of the Scorpion (Scorpius).","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC-6302-LRGB-Ha-OIII.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 6302: The Butterfly Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC-6302-LRGB-Ha-OIII_1024.jpg"},{"date":"2025-06-07","explanation":"On the Mars rover's mission Sol 46 or Earth date April 6, 2021, Perseverance held out a robotic arm to take its first selfie on Mars. The WATSON camera at the end of the arm was designed to take close-ups of Martian rocks and surface details though, and not a quick snap shot of friends and smiling faces. In the end, teamwork and weeks of planning on Mars time was required to program a complex series of exposures and camera motions to include Perseverance and its surroundings. The resulting 62 frames were composed into a detailed mosaic, one of the most complicated Mars rover selfies ever taken. In this version of the selfie, the rover's Mastcam-Z and SuperCam instruments are looking toward WATSON and the end of the rover's outstretched arm. About 4 meters (13 feet) from Perseverance is a robotic companion, the Mars Ingenuity helicopter. Perseverance has now spent over 1,500 sols exploring the surface of the Red Planet. On Earth date January 18, 2024, Ingenuity made its 72nd and final flight through the thin Martian atmosphere.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/PIA24542_fig2.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Perseverance Selfie with Ingenuity","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/PIA24542_fig2_1100c.jpg"},{"date":"2025-06-08","explanation":"From our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy, we see NGC 3344 face-on. Nearly 40,000 light-years across, the big, beautiful spiral galaxy is located just 20 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo Minor. This multi-color Hubble Space Telescope close-up of NGC 3344 includes remarkable details from near infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths. The frame extends some 15,000 light-years across the spiral's central regions. From the core outward, the galaxy's colors change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions along the loose, fragmented spiral arms. Of course, the bright stars with a spiky appearance are in front of NGC 3344 and lie well within our own Milky Way.

Likely not \u2014 because this is a discovery image.  Massive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, after a few million years, end their lives in powerful supernova explosions. These remnants cool relatively quickly and fade, making them difficult to detect.  To uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, a dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through sky surveys for possible supernova remnant candidates.  The result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 \u2014 named Scylla by its discoverers\u2014glowing faintly in the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: Cepheus.  Emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red, and faint emission from oxygen is shown in hues of blue.  Surprisingly, another discovery lurked to the upper right: a faint, previously unknown planetary nebula candidate. In keeping with mythological tradition, it was named Charybdis (Sai 2) \u2014 a nod to the ancient Greek expression \"caught between Scylla and Charybdis\" from Homer\u2019s Odyssey.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_2094.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Between Scylla and Charybdis: A Double Cosmic Discovery","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_960.jpg"}]
